# Mesh Sensitivity Classifier
AI/ML-based approach for identifying critical mesh zones needing refinement in CAE (FEA/CFD) workflows.

This repository contains the Mesh Sensitivity Classifier — a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based model built using PyTorch Geometric.
The model predicts sensitivity levels (low/medium/high) for mesh elements in Finite Element (FEA) or Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) analyses.
The goal is to automate detection of zones requiring local mesh refinement to improve accuracy while minimizing computational cost.
